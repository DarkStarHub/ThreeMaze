# How I worked on this project

My goal was to learn an interesting new library to build something out of the ordinary to demonstrate creativity and ability to learn
and apply new tech rapidly and effectively.

- For the project I decided to create a maze for a player to navigate, including obstacles, using a recursive backtracker algo to carve a unique maze each run.
- No plugins or game engines, just HTML, CSS, Javascript and Javascript libraries. 
- I chose to learn and implement Three.js to render the 3D assests, and I chose to learn and implement Cannon.js to handle the physics. 
- I drew on previous experience with art packages (including myaya and blender) to create the 3D art assests, while familiarizing myself with the 3d libraries.
- My previous experience with building mobile games made the development rapid, and I found Three.js and Cannon.j worked well together and were easy to use.

# Navigating the project
The script.js file in the JS folder contains all the game logic. The other files are required for the previously mentioned libraries, and the minified libraries themselves.
