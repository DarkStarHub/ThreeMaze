# How I worked on this project

My goal was to learn an interesting new library to build something out of the ordinary to demonstrate creativity and ability to learn
and apply new tech rapidly and effectively.

- I decided to create a maze for a player to navigate, with obstacles, using a recursive backtracker algo to carve a unique maze each run
- for the 3d assets, I choose to learn and implement Three.js, and I chose to learn and implement Cannon.js to handle the physics. 
- I drew on previous experience with art packages to create 3D art assests, while familiarizing myself with the 3d libraries
